This bot is now discontinued since i don't really care about it anymore. I might work on other things soon tough.

# Novus's Bot
source code for Novus's Bot on discord

Sorry bud, you cannot invite this bot anymore!

<h2><strong>What is this for?</strong></h2>
<p>This bot was made in Bot designer for discord but the app is very limited and it requires an ad to bring it online. So i decided to redo the bot in discord.js. since im nice, im giving everyone the source code.<br /></p>

<h2><strong>But why?<br /></strong></h2>
<p>boredom. also look below for setup instructions</p>

<h2>Preparing the bot (incase anyone wants to mess with the bot)</h2>
<h3>you'll need the following items:</h3>
<ul>
<li>discord.js 12.5.1</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code</li>
<li>The latest release of node.js (recommended 12.16.1)</li>
<li>a bot created from Discord's Developer Portal</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting up the bot before starting it up</h3>
<ol>
<li>open visual studio code</li>
<li>open the bot's folder</li>
<li>click on terminal on top of the screen</li>
<li>click "New Terminal"</li>
<li>type in npm install discord.js and press enter. it will install all the important parts for the bot to work</li>
<li>go to the discord developer portal and select a bot</li>
<li>go to the bots section and click "Copy Token"</li>
<li>go back to visual studio code and go to conf/config.json</li>
<li>replace the token (in quotes) with your bots token</li>
</ol>
<h3>Starting the bot</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you haven't opened the terminal or closed it, reopen it</li>
<li>type in node index</li>
<li>wait a second</li>
</ol>
<p>If you see Novus Bot Status: Online then you are ready to go!</p>
<p>If you see an error and the bot shutting down, please check the token in conf/config.json. if you put the token in and you still receive an error. please check all the packages or report it to our staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep the terminal and visual studio open. to safely shut down the bot, press CTRL + C inside the terminal.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
