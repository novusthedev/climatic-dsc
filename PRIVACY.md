<h1>About Climatic Privacy</h1>
<p>Here's what you need to know when using Climatic.<p>

<h2>Discord API</h2>
</p>Some commands like "User Information" grab specific user information (e.g; username, avatar, banner, etc.) that are are available through Discord's API.</p>
<p>Although the Discord API can grant us access to E-Mails through OAuth2, We only use our OAuth2 link to install commands to a user or server, which doesn't grant us access to that information.</p>

<h2>What do we collect?</h2>
<p>We log command executions for debug purposes. We only collect the following:</p>
<li>Usernames</li>
<li>User ID's</li>
<li>Name of command executed</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>None of these logs are saved and are lost when the bot is stopped.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We DON'T collect the following from users:</p>
<li>Any sensitive information (E-mail, phone, etc)</li>
<li>Any IP or physical addresses</li>
<li>Any command arguments</li>

<h2>Safe Mode</h2>
<p>Safe mode is enabled by default in main instances and only show certain command results to the executor to protect privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Third party notices</h2>
<p></p>Some commands may send arguments to a third party service. This information is only used to recieve the result of the command & we'll never use it for anything else. Note that external services have their own privacy policies and may treat this data differently.</p>
